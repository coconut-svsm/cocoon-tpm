# Cocoon TPM project

Rust workspace for developing a software TPM. **Work in progess!**

Everything is `[no_std]` and has been developed with constrained
execution environments in mind, in partiuclar with regard to stack usage.

## Available crates
* [`cocoon-tpm-utils-common`](utils-common/README.md) - Utilities used
  by the other components.
* [`cocoon-tpm-utils-async`](utils-async/README.md) - Utilities related
  to Rust's async used by the other components.
* [`cocoon-tpm-tpm2-interface`](tpm2-cmd-interface/README.md) -
  Autogenerated definitions, (un)marshalling code etc. of the TCG TPM2
  interface structures. Will get populated on an as-needed basis.
* [`cocoon-tpm-crypto`](crypto/README.md) - A common interface to (and
  in part implementations of) all cryptography primitives needed by a
  TPM.
* [`cocoon-tpm-storage`](storage/README.md) - Secure persistent storage.
